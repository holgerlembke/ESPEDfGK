# ESP32/ESP8266 Exception Decoder for Generation Klick

So in there endless wisdom the Arduino IDE has different priorities than to recreate the 
old infrastructure and https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder does not work anymore.

And /me being to lazy to use the existing command line version from 
https://github.com/littleyoda/EspStackTraceDecoder does instead build a C# WPF app to help me.

This is a work in progress thing. I do debugging as I need.
